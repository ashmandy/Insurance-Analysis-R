# Insurance Cost Prediction (R Project)

## Objective
Predict insurance charges based on demographic and health factors using linear regression.

## Tools Used
- R, tidyverse, caret, ggplot2

## Process
1. Data cleaning & exploration
2. Correlation analysis
3. Train/test split (80/20)
4. Linear regression modeling
5. Performance evaluation (R² = 0.79, RMSE ≈ $5,343)

## Key Findings
- Smoking increases charges by ~$21,500.
- Higher BMI and older age increase predicted costs.
- Model explains ~79% of cost variation.

## Files
- `insurance_analysis.R`: R script
- `insurance.csv`: dataset

### Notes
I’m actively learning best practices in model evaluation, feature selection, and visualization.  
Any feedback or suggestions for improving the analysis, workflow, or documentation are always welcome.
